Here is a detailed flow chart and explanation to describe the process of running a Spark job via Airflow while leveraging data and resources located in a Hadoop cluster. The interaction involves several components, including Airflow, the Hadoop cluster, and the spark-submit process. Below is the Mermaid flow chart to represent this interaction.

Explanation of Components
Airflow DAG Trigger:

A DAG in Airflow triggers the task to submit a Spark job. This step typically uses the SparkSubmitOperator.
SparkSubmitOperator:

The operator is configured to use the spark-submit command with appropriate configurations such as the application JAR/py file, resource allocation (e.g., memory, CPU), and dependencies.
Spark-Submit Command:

This command connects to the Hadoop/YARN cluster, passing job details to the Resource Manager.
YARN Resource Manager:

Allocates cluster resources for the job by coordinating with the cluster nodes (Hadoop cluster).
Cluster Manager:

In the case of YARN, it spawns Spark Executors on worker nodes.
Spark Executors:

Executors perform the actual computation by processing data from HDFS or other Hadoop-compatible storage systems.
HDFS:

Data is read from and written back to HDFS as part of the Spark job.
Spark Driver:

Orchestrates the execution, tracks task progress, and reports job status.
Airflow Logs:

Logs the execution details and any errors, making them accessible through the Airflow UI.
Task Completion:

Once the Spark job is complete, Airflow marks the task as completed in the DAG execution timeline.
This architecture ensures a seamless interaction between Airflow, Spark, and Hadoop resources, automating the workflow and monitoring progress.
