Problem: After HDFS NameNode failover, some Dremio tables lose format/metadata and require manual repair.
Plan:

Monitor and detect NameNode failover events (active ↔ standby switch).

Trigger an automated remediation workflow to correct Dremio table format/metadata issues.

Execute post-fix validation: sanity checks across Dremio and dependent applications to confirm data access and consistency
