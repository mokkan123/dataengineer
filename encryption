We can assist with implementing password encryption for your request. However, we require some validation regarding the Druid configuration file before proceeding.

Could you confirm the location of this file?

Is it stored locally on the OS, or
Is it managed within HDFS?
Additionally, based on our review of the Apache Druid documentation, we would like to verify whether your requirement specifically pertains to druid.metadata.storage.connector.password as outlined here:
ðŸ”— Druid Password Provider Documentation

If this is the case, we will proceed with developing a custom PasswordProvider using Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault. However, we have not yet tested this integration and will need to validate its functionality before full deployment.
