📌 DG-UPLOAD → HDFS Investigation Questions

1️⃣ Can you share the full DG-UPLOAD-Service stack trace with the exact timestamp of the failure?

2️⃣ When did this issue start, and how frequently is it occurring?

3️⃣ At the time of failure, were you able to access https://hdfs
? Did it load normally, slowly, or not at all?

4️⃣ Does the issue happen randomly, during peak hours, or on every upload?

5️⃣ If it happens again, can you capture:

Exact time of occurrence

These details will help us determine whether this is an application, network, or HDFS service issue.
