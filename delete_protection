NameNode Delete Protection – Detailed Summary
dfs.namenode.delete.rate.limit
Overview

dfs.namenode.delete.rate.limit is a NameNode protection parameter designed to throttle delete operations per second in HDFS. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the NameNode from delete storms that can destabilize the cluster control plane.

In large-scale environments, especially those running Spark or Hive workloads, massive recursive directory deletions are common. Without safeguards, these delete bursts can overwhelm the NameNode and lead to:

Massive recursive delete pressure

FSNamesystem lock contention

Edit log overload

RPC queue congestion

Stale DataNode cascades

Because the NameNode manages all metadata in memory, uncontrolled delete activity directly impacts cluster stability.
