You are accessing the HDFS NameNode UI over HTTPS, but when you attempt to download a file, the request is redirected to a DataNode over HTTP instead of HTTPS.

This results in mixed content — a secure webpage (HTTPS) attempting to load an insecure resource (HTTP). Modern Google Chrome versions block all active mixed content, including file downloads, scripts, and frames.

Chrome’s behavior is straightforward:

The NameNode UI is loaded securely over HTTPS

The DataNode download link uses HTTP

Since the browser sees a downgrade from HTTPS → HTTP, it flags the request as mixed content and blocks the download for security reasons.

How to fix this

Enable HTTPS on all DataNodes
Install and configure SSL certificates so both NameNode and DataNode URLs use HTTPS. This provides end-to-end encryption and ensures Chrome does not block the download.

Temporary workaround
Use Firefox or Microsoft Edge, which still allow mixed-content downloads with fewer restrictions.
