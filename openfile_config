How to Find Which Process is Using the Most Open File Descriptors in Datadog
As a Datadog Expert, here’s how you can leverage existing Datadog features to identify processes consuming the most open file descriptors.

Step 1: Enable Process Monitoring in Datadog
To monitor open file descriptors per process, ensure Live Process Monitoring is enabled.

Verify if Process Monitoring is Already Enabled
Run the following command to check if process monitoring is active:

sh
Copy
Edit
sudo datadog-agent status | grep "process"
If it’s not enabled, follow these steps:

Enable Process Monitoring
Edit the Datadog Agent config file:
sh
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
Find the process_config section and modify it:
yaml
Copy
Edit
process_config:
  enabled: "true"
  process_collection: "true"
Restart the Datadog Agent:
sh
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
Step 2: View Per-Process Open File Descriptor Usage in Datadog UI
Go to Datadog UI:

Navigate to Live Processes → Datadog Live Process Monitoring.
Filter for Open File Descriptors:

In the search bar, enter:
text
Copy
Edit
process.open_file_descriptors
This will show processes sorted by the number of open file descriptors.
Sort by "Open File Descriptors":

Click on the process.open_file_descriptors column.
Identify processes with high usage.
Drill Down into a Specific Process:

Click on a process to see:
Command line arguments (process.command)
Memory & CPU usage
Open file descriptor trends over time
Step 3: Create a Dashboard to Continuously Track Open File Descriptors
You can create a Datadog Dashboard to visualize processes with high open file descriptor usage.

Add a "Top List" Widget
Go to Datadog → Dashboards → New Dashboard.
Click "Add Widget" → Select "Top List".
Use this query:
text
Copy
Edit
avg:process.open_file_descriptors{*} by {process_name}
Title: "Processes with Most Open File Descriptors"
Save the Widget.
Step 4: Set Up an Alert for High Open File Descriptor Usage
To prevent file descriptor exhaustion, create a Datadog monitor.

Create a New Monitor
Go to "Monitors" → "New Monitor".
Select "Metric Monitor".
Enter the query:
text
Copy
Edit
process.open_file_descriptors{*} by {process_name}
Set Alert Conditions:
Warning: > 5000 open file descriptors
Critical: > 8000 open file descriptors
Configure Notifications (Slack, Email, PagerDuty, etc.).
Save and Activate.
Step 5: Use Log Management for Further Investigation (Optional)
If you want detailed logging of which files a process has open:

Enable Datadog Log Collection

In datadog.yaml:
yaml
Copy
Edit
logs_enabled: true
Restart the agent:
sh
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart datadog-agent
Filter Logs for High Open File Usage

Go to Datadog → Logs.
Search:
text
Copy
Edit
process_name:your_app AND process.open_file_descriptors:*
Identify if a specific file is causing excessive usage.
