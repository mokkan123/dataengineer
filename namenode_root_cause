According to the GC logs, we noticed a slight increase in pause time, which reached a maximum of 133 milliseconds. The change from 90 milliseconds to 130 milliseconds is minor and not considered significant. Therefore, it can be safely disregarded at this level.

Attached the Grafana screenshot and the GC log for further details.
