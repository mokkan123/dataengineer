Summary: Addressing HDFS Slowness â€“ Root Causes and Action Items

HDFS slowness was traced to multiple contributing factors, including an oversized FSImage, high disk I/O, and excessive job activity.

Actions Taken:

Reduced the FSImage size from 8.5 GB to 2.5 GB by cleaning up obsolete files in the /tmp directory.

Identified frequent checkpoints occurring every 5 minutes due to high disk I/O delays preventing condition checks. Resolved by increasing the FSImage upload timeout between the Secondary and Primary NameNode, ensuring proper checkpoint intervals and reducing unnecessary disk writes.

Collaborated with the application team to remove redundant or outdated jobs impacting NameNode performance.

Identified a Datadog agent job executing hdfs dfs -count every 2 minutes. This has been temporarily disabled and will be rescheduled to run once daily.

Continuous monitoring is ongoing via Ambari Metrics and Datadog to proactively detect and mitigate further performance spikes.
