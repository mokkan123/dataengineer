This configuration defines a high-availability distributed system for big data processing. The setup integrates Hadoop components, Spark for distributed data processing, and Airflow for workflow orchestration. Here's a detailed summary of the components and their interactions:

Cluster Components
Zookeeper Cluster:

Consists of three nodes: ZK1 (zmn01), ZK2 (zmn02), and ZK3 (zmn03).
Manages distributed coordination and synchronization between components.
Provides failover support for NameNode and Resource Managers.
Journal Node Cluster:

Contains three nodes: JN1 (zmn01), JN2 (zmn02), and JN3 (zmn03).
Facilitates shared edits for the Active and Standby NameNodes to maintain consistency in the HDFS metadata.
NameNode Cluster:

Two nodes are configured:
Active Node: NN1 (hmn01).
Standby Node: NN2 (hmn02).
Ensures HDFS high availability with automatic failover using Zookeeper and JournalNodes.
YARN Cluster:

Resource Managers:
RM1 (hmn01) - Active Resource Manager.
RM2 (hmn02) - Standby Resource Manager.
Manages job scheduling and cluster resource allocation.
Data Nodes:

Six nodes (DN1 to DN6) host the actual HDFS data blocks and handle data storage and retrieval.
Integrated with the NameNodes for block storage and replication.
Yarn Compute Nodes:

Six nodes (CN1 to CN6) run MapReduce and YARN applications for distributed computation.
Spark Master Nodes:

Three Spark Master Nodes (SM1, SM2, SM3).
Handle job submission, resource allocation, and distributed execution using YARN.
Airflow Master Node:

A single Airflow Master Node (AMN) at amn03.
Orchestrates Spark jobs and other workflows by coordinating with Spark Master nodes.
Key Interactions
NameNode and Journal Nodes:

NN1 (Active NameNode) writes metadata to JN1, JN2, and JN3.
NN2 (Standby NameNode) reads metadata from the JournalNodes to stay synchronized.
Zookeeper Coordination:

Journal Nodes (JN1, JN2, JN3) use Zookeeper (ZK1, ZK2, ZK3) for coordination.
Resource Managers and Spark Masters also communicate with Zookeeper for failover and cluster management.
Resource and Compute Management:

RM1 and RM2 manage compute nodes (CN1 to CN6) for YARN jobs.
Spark Masters (SM1, SM2, SM3) connect to Resource Managers to allocate resources for Spark jobs.
Airflow Orchestration:

Airflow Master Node (AMN) orchestrates workflows by submitting Spark jobs to Spark Master Nodes (SM1, SM2, SM3).
Data Flow:

NameNodes (NN1, NN2) manage data flow to and from Data Nodes (DN1 to DN6).
Spark Masters exchange data with the NameNodes during job execution.
Spark and Airflow Integration:

Spark Masters submit results and metadata back to Airflow for workflow continuation.
AMN ensures job orchestration and monitoring.
