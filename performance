ðŸ”¹ Impact of Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) on HDFS Performance
Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) introduces some performance overhead, but it remains manageable and does not significantly impact overall system efficiency.

âœ” Write operations experience a greater performance impact than reads since encryption is performed at the client side before data is stored in HDFS.
âœ” Read operations are less affected, as decryption occurs only when authorized users or applications retrieve the data.
âœ” In summary, read operations maintain faster data retrieval compared to write-intensive tasks, making TDE well-suited for environments with performance SLAs focused on data access. ðŸš€
