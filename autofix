Proposed Automation Workflow
1. Baseline Dataset Format Snapshot

Extract the current data format metadata for all Dremio datasets.

Store this baseline snapshot in a structured Excel file or centralized repository.

This snapshot will serve as the source of truth for expected dataset formats.

2. Periodic Format Validation & Alerting

Execute an automated validation script on a scheduled basis.

Compare the current dataset format in Dremio with the baseline snapshot.

If a format mismatch is detected:

Notify the dataset owner(s) or owning group.

Request confirmation on whether the change was intentional or accidental.

Based on confirmation:

Intentional change → Update the baseline snapshot.

Unintentional change → Trigger the auto-fix or remediation workflow.

3. Root Cause Monitoring & Event Tracking

Implement continuous monitoring for known system events that may cause dataset format loss and correlate them with detected anomalies.

a. HDFS NameNode Events

Detect NameNode failures, failovers, or metadata inconsistencies.

Flag dataset format changes occurring immediately after these events.

b. Dremio Executor Events

Monitor executor restarts, failures, or YARN container re-allocations.

Correlate executor-related events with dataset format anomalies.

c. Access & Permission Changes

Track Active Directory (AD) group membership and permission changes.

Correlate access-related events with dataset format anomalies.
