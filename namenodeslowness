HDFS Namenode Slowness: Root Cause Analysis & Recommendations
üìÖ Issue Summary
We have been observing HDFS slowness for the past few weeks/months. After extensive review, several contributing factors have been identified, particularly around disk I/O latency, checkpointing behavior, and job-induced load on the NameNode.

üîç Identified Root Causes
1. High Disk I/O Wait on NameNode
Observed Wait Time: ~500‚Äì1200 ms

Impact: Prolonged I/O wait impacts fsimage write, edit log sync, and RPC responsiveness.

Action: Infrastructure limitation acknowledged. No further action possible at this time ‚Äî to be treated as a baseline.

‚úÖ Actionable Solutions to Reduce Namenode Load
A. Reduce Unnecessary Workloads
Observation: Tools like Dremio, frequent Spark jobs, or metadata-heavy operations (e.g., HBase scans, file listings) contribute to load.

Recommendation: Audit and suppress non-critical or redundant jobs to reduce metadata traffic and RPC queue backlog.

B. Increase Spark History Server Timeouts
Problem: Aggressive polling by Spark History Server creates frequent fsync and .inprogress writes to HDFS.

Recommended Settings:

bash
Copy
Edit
spark.history.fs.update.interval=60s     # default is 10s
spark.eventLog.buffer.kb=2048            # default is 100 KB
spark.eventLog.compress=true             # reduce write pressure
C. Enable fsimage Compression
Benefit: Reduces size of fsimage being transferred to the NameNode.

Setting:

xml
Copy
Edit
<property>
  <name>dfs.image.compress</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
üßæ Checkpointing Behavior Review
‚ùó Issue: Frequent Checkpoints (every ~6 minutes)
Expected: Checkpoints should happen every 3600 seconds (1 hour) or after large transaction counts.

Observed: Occurs every 6 minutes, likely due to timeout/ack failures, even though image is processed successfully.

üîß Current Relevant Settings
Parameter	Description	Default	Observed Behavior
dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period	Minimum time between checkpoints	3600s	Not respected due to retries
dfs.namenode.checkpoint.check.period	Interval to check if checkpoint is due	60s	Default
dfs.image.transfer.timeout	Timeout for uploading fsimage	60s	Too low for current fsimage size

‚úî Recommendation:
Increase timeout to accommodate slower disk/network:

xml
Copy
Edit
<property>
  <name>dfs.image.transfer.timeout</name>
  <value>300000</value> <!-- 5 minutes -->
</property>
üß† Conclusion
While disk I/O limitations cannot be mitigated, we recommend tuning Spark, checkpoint frequency, and transfer timeouts to reduce NameNode pressure. These improvements will:

Reduce fsync calls and .inprogress write traffic.

Prevent excessive checkpoint retries.

Optimize edit log replay and memory utilization.
